## 📊 COVID-19 Explorer Dashboard

![COVID Dashboard](covid_explorer.png)

*📌 Project Overview:*  
Built an interactive dashboard to explore COVID-19 trends across India and global vaccine distribution.

*🔍 Key Insights:*

- 📈 *Daily & Cumulative Trends*:
  - Daily spikes in confirmed cases were highly visible during the second wave (April–May 2021).
  - Recovery rates improved significantly in major states after June 2021.

- 🗺️ *State-wise Impact*:
  - Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka consistently had the highest case counts.
  - Northeast states showed delayed but steep spikes compared to early-hit regions.

- 📊 *Active vs. Recovered Cases*:
  - Slicers allowed users to filter and compare states where recovery rates exceeded 95% versus those with high active case percentages.
  - Line charts highlighted when recoveries started to outpace daily confirmed cases.

- 🌍 *Global Vaccination Trends*:
  - Countries like the USA and UK showed early high vaccine rollout, while some low-income countries lagged.
  - India showed sharp growth in vaccine administration post-May 2021.

- 💉 *Vaccine Milestones*:
  - Milestone dates (e.g., crossing 100 million doses) were marked.
  - Country-wise comparison revealed disparities in 1st vs 2nd dose completion.

- 🔎 *Advanced Slicer Use*:
  - Multiple slicers added for filtering by:
    - *Case Type*: Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths
    - *Time Range*: Specific month, quarter, year
    - *State Name or Country*
  - Enabled quick comparisons and trend discovery between states and countries

- 🧠 *Anomaly Detection*:
  - Missing or outdated data for certain regions (e.g., sudden drop in reporting) was highlighted.
  - Helped identify gaps in public health reporting systems.

*🛠 Tools & Skills Used:*
- *Power BI*: Data modeling, DAX, slicers, interactive visuals
- *Excel*: Pre-cleaning raw CSV datasets, merging data sources
- *Storytelling with Data*: Crafting a visual narrative from real-world health data
- *Critical Thinking*: Identified root causes and trends behind spikes
